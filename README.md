# Course-ify

Course-ify is a full stack web application that converts a YouTube video into an interactive course - Empowered by AI!

Copy and paste your YouTube link, and get your courses by one click!

* Each video is retold by texts - a readable course.

* Each course is divided by auto generated **section** tabs - an organized course.

* Each section has a number of **quizzes** (one can do in real time!) that helps reinforcement - a responsive course.

Read the summaries, do the quizzes, complete the courses. We make learning more accessible.
